# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Pirate Intelligent Agent: Deep Q-Learning for Pathfinding

## üöÄ Project Summary - Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For the project, I was given code to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm to train a pirate NPC to find the treasure before the player. I was given starter code that consisted of the game environment setup, movement mechanics, and basic agent interactions. My contribution focused on implementing the reinforcement learning logic, including the neural network, decision-making logic and the reward system. Through iterative training, the pirate agent progressively learned to navigate efficiently, balancing exploration and exploitation.

## üñ•Ô∏è What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and optimize algorithms to solve real-world problems.  These problems can consist of various forms of automoation for a range of problems in industries such as health, automotive, finance, and more.  This also includes AI.  Overall, Computer Scientists apply structured problem-solving techniques, transforming abstract ideas into functional software solutions. Their contributions shape the digital world, enabling innovation across industries.

## üß† How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist, this means breaking things down into logical steps and applying systematic strategies. Instead of trial-and-error, structured algorithms and data-driven learning guide CS solutions. In this project, deep reinforcement learning allowed the pirate agent to refine its decision-making based on past experiences. This analytical mindset helps tackle complex challenges suuch as AI

## ‚öñÔ∏è What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Building intelligent systems requires considering fairness, transparency, and potential biases. AI should be designed to enhance user experiences without exploiting game mechanics or creating unfair advantages. Developers have a responsibility to ensure their algorithms behave predictably and ethically within the system. In this case, the pirate agent was optimized for fair competition, making gameplay both challenging and enjoyable.  That way, everyone can feel good about playing the game instead of specific subsets of users.
